# DeepLearning
This repo contain all my Deep Learning work completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks markdown files. 
Out of many framework avaliable for Deep Learning I have build my specialization working on the following frameworks.

## PyTorch
  - [Wheat Seed Dataset](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hargurjeet/DeepLearning/blob/main/Wheat_Seeds_Analysis_Pytorch_blogs.ipynb): The datasets involve the prediction of species given measurements of seeds from different varieties of wheat. I build a logistic regression model and achieved an accuracy of **78% under 15 epochs**.
  - [CFAR-10](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cifar-10): The dataset contains over **60,000 images** belonging to 10 classes. I have developed the following neural networks to evaluate their performance.
    - Built [Feed Forward neural network(ANN)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hargurjeet/DeepLearning/blob/main/CFAR_10_Dataset.ipynb) and achievied an accurcy of **48%**.
    - Built [Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hargurjeet/DeepLearning/blob/main/CNN_CFAR_10_Dataset.ipynb) and improved the accuracy till **75%**.
    - Applied technique like Data normalization, Data augmentation, Batch normalization, Learning rate scheduling, Weight Decay, Gradient clipping...etc to further improve the model **accuracy to 90%**. You can access my notebook [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hargurjeet/DeepLearning/blob/main/CFAR_10_Image_Classifier.ipynb)


### Blogs on PyTorch
I like writing and love to explain my work in layman's language. Through these blogs, I reach out to the general audiences who are not familiar with these technologies and want to learn in this area

## Tensorflow
  - [GTSRB Dataset](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hargurjeet/DeepLearning/blob/main/GTRSB%20-%20CNN%20%28TensorFlow%29.ipynb): The dataset contains over **39k images** and over **40 classes**. I have to build a neural network with CNN architecture using Tensorflow and applying techniques like image augmentation to achieve accuracy of **85%**.
