# DeepLearning
This repo contain all my Deep Learning work completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks markdown files. 
Out of many framework avaliable for Deep Learning I have build my specialization working on the following frameworks.

## PyTorch
  - [Wheat Seed Dataset](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hargurjeet/DeepLearning/blob/main/Wheat_Seeds_Analysis_Pytorch_blogs.ipynb): The datasets involves the prediction of species given measurements of seeds from different varieties of wheat. I build a logistic regression model and achievied accruacy of 78% under 15 epcohs.
  - [CFAR-10](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hargurjeet/DeepLearning/blob/main/CFAR_10_Dataset.ipynb): The dataset contains over 60,000 images. I have build the model to predict the class of oject out of 10 classes using Feed forward neural network. Able to achieve accuray of about 48% and analysed the limitation of the model.


## Tensorflow
  - [GTSRB Dataset](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hargurjeet/DeepLearning/blob/main/GTRSB%20-%20CNN%20%28TensorFlow%29.ipynb): The dataset contains over 39k images. I have to build a neural network with CNN architecture using Tensorflow and applying techniques like image augmentation to achieve accuracy of **85%**


I also dabble in all other technology. You can access by complete portfolio [here](https://github.com/hargurjeet/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/README.md)
