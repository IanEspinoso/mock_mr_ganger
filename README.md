# DeepLearning
This repo contain all my Deep Learning work completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks markdown files. 
Out of many framework avaliable for Deep Learning I have build my specialization working on the following frameworks.

## PyTorch
  - [Wheat Seed Dataset](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hargurjeet/DeepLearning/blob/main/Wheat_Seeds_Analysis_Pytorch_blogs.ipynb): The datasets involves the prediction of species given measurements of seeds from different varieties of wheat. I build a logistic regression model and achievied accruacy of 78% under 15 epcohs.
  - [CFAR-10](https://github.com/hargurjeet/DeepLearning/blob/main/CFAR_10_Dataset.ipynb): The dataset contains over 60,000 images. I have build the model to predict the class of oject out of 10 classes using Feed forward neural network.


## Tensorflow
Project updates in progress


I also dabble in all other technology. You can access by complete portfolio [here](https://github.com/hargurjeet/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/README.md)
