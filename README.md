# DeepLearning
This repo contain all my Deep Learning work completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks markdown files. 
Out of many framework avaliable for Deep Learning I have build my specialization working on the following frameworks.

## PyTorch
  - [Wheat Seed Dataset](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hargurjeet/DeepLearning/blob/main/Wheat_Seeds_Analysis_Pytorch_blogs.ipynb): The datasets involve the prediction of species given measurements of seeds from different varieties of wheat. I build a logistic regression model and achieved an accuracy of **78% under 15 epochs**.
  - [CFAR-10](): The dataset contains over **60,000 images** belonging to 10 classes. I have developed the following neural networks to evaluate their performance.
    - Built [Feed Forward neural network(ANN)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hargurjeet/DeepLearning/blob/main/CFAR_10_Dataset.ipynb) and achievied an accurcy of **48%**.
    - Built [CNN]() improved the accuracy till **75%**.
    - Applied technique like Regularization, Dropout to further improve the model performace.

## Tensorflow
  - [GTSRB Dataset](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hargurjeet/DeepLearning/blob/main/GTRSB%20-%20CNN%20%28TensorFlow%29.ipynb): The dataset contains over **39k images** and over **40 classes**. I have to build a neural network with CNN architecture using Tensorflow and applying techniques like image augmentation to achieve accuracy of **85%**.


I also dabble in all other technology. You can access by complete portfolio [here](https://github.com/hargurjeet/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/README.md)
